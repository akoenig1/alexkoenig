A semi-faux personal website I'm styling while following along with
the Intermediate CSS section of Angela Yu's Complete 2021 Web 
Development Bootcamp on Udemy. This project is meant to brush up
on my CSS skills so I can increase the efficiency with which I
bring all the cool designs I think of in my head to life for my
other more serious projects.
